🩺 Disease Prediction Toolkit: Building and Evaluating ML Models
📌 Project Overview

The Disease Prediction Toolkit is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of diseases using healthcare datasets (e.g., Heart Disease, Diabetes).
This toolkit helps beginners understand data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization while building a professional portfolio project for AI/ML in healthcare.


🎯 Objectives
